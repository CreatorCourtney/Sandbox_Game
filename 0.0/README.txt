First working version of the game... Working being a relative term

As of right now you can't do very much, you kind of just place logs and bridges on a really stupid looking world,
there aren't really even any objectives or reason to be placing these blocks though. 

Upon further development, I plan for the player to use these building mechanics to create and maintain a base, maintain being a key word here.
I plan for the combat in this game to be based not so much around attacking enemies, but rather defending your base, and rather than clicking on enemies to shoot,
you need to upkeep your base as a powerful defence in order to win.

I'm thinking there can be a sort of bimodality in the gameplay, where during the day the game is a relatively relaxing experience where you can collect resources and build
preparations, then during the night is when things get a bit more hectic. Ideally there will be an array of different enemy types that require different maintenance
tactics to effectively fight against.

There is a lot to do, so below is my immediate to do list:

- add enemies
  - starting with some basic enemies that just follow you and damage your buildings
  - land based, would add some sort of objective to the game

- add resource collection
  - currently you are spawned with 100 logs and bridges, and no way to get more
  - there can be ways to collect raw resources, that can be crafted into building materials

- on the note of crafting in the last point, add crafting mechanics

- improve building mechanics. the player shouldn't be able to fill cells instantaneously, as this will likely lead to exploits
  where you can just indefinitely block enemies out of your base by spamming buildings

- think of some motivation. Give the player a reason to play and build a base. this doesn't necesarily need to be ADDED yet, just considered

- improve graphics
  - stop using a reused asset for the player
  - add shorelines to the river's edge, instead of the sharp cutoff
  - MAKE ANIMATIONS!! currently the player just slides across the screen, it should be animated
